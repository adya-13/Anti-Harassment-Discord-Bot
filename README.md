# Anti-Harassment-Discord-Bot

A bot that identifies bad words in a discord message and scolds the sender.

## How to setup
Proceed as follows:  
`git clone https://github.com/adya-13/Anti-Harassment-Discord-Bot.git`  
`cd Anti-Harassment-discord-bot`  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`  
Create a bot application in discord and copy the generated URL and add the bot to your server.  
Then create a '.env' file in the folder and write DISCORD_TOKEN=<discord_token> where "<discord_token>" is generated on creating the bot application.

 VOILA! You're good to go.
